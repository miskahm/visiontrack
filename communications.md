- **Main Agent**: Committed and pushed all agents implementation to GitHub

#### Streamlit Application
- **Main Agent**: Created complete Streamlit app.py with webcam, video file, and image support
- **Main Agent**: Integrated all 5 agents (Detection, Tracking, ModelManager, Label, Logging)
- **Main Agent**: Added real-time FPS and statistics display
- **Main Agent**: Implemented interactive object class selection UI
- **Main Agent**: Added visual overlay with bounding boxes and track IDs
- **Main Agent**: Configured adjustable confidence threshold slider
- **Main Agent**: Updated README with comprehensive usage instructions
- **Main Agent**: Formatted and linted all code
- **Main Agent**: Committed and pushed complete application to GitHub

#### Bug Fixes & Performance Improvements (Round 1)
- **Main Agent**: Fixed crash when removing all tracked objects (class_filter now handles empty list)
- **Main Agent**: Added IOU threshold slider for tracking accuracy control (0.1-0.9)
- **Main Agent**: Added frame skip slider for performance optimization (0-5 frames)
- **Main Agent**: Improved FPS from 15-20 to potentially 30+ with frame skip enabled
- **Main Agent**: Added frame_count to session state for frame skip logic
- **Main Agent**: Updated README with performance tips
- **Main Agent**: Updated AGENTS.md and todo.md with latest status

#### Real-time Parameter Updates & Webcam Optimization (Round 2)
- **Main Agent**: Implemented @st.cache_resource for model loading (loads once, cached forever)
- **Main Agent**: Fixed slow webcam startup with proper session state management
- **Main Agent**: Enabled real-time parameter adjustment without restart (all sliders update on-the-fly)
- **Main Agent**: Added webcam buffer optimization (CAP_PROP_BUFFERSIZE=1 for lower latency)
- **Main Agent**: Improved Start/Stop button UI with emojis and better layout
- **Main Agent**: Used st.rerun() for continuous webcam feed without blocking
- **Main Agent**: Proper webcam resource cleanup on stop
- **Main Agent**: Updated README with real-time adjustment instructions
- **Main Agent**: Updated all documentation (AGENTS.md, todo.md, communications.md)

#### Critical Bug Fixes - Webcam Issues (Round 3)
- **Task Agent**: Debugged and identified infinite rerun loop and button duplication issues
- **Main Agent**: Fixed duplicate Start/Stop buttons appearing (both buttons now always visible)
- **Main Agent**: Added button disabled state to prevent double-clicking
- **Main Agent**: Fixed flickering by showing both buttons but disabling inactive one
- **Main Agent**: Improved webcam initialization with spinner feedback
- **Main Agent**: Better error handling when webcam not initialized
- **Main Agent**: Maintained st.rerun() for continuous feed but with proper state management
- **Main Agent**: 0.01s sleep to prevent CPU spike while allowing parameter updates

#### UI Stability Final Fixes (Round 4)
- **Main Agent**: Increased sleep interval from 0.01s to 0.03s to further reduce flickering
- **Main Agent**: Verified button state management prevents movement issues
- **Main Agent**: Webcam buffer optimization confirmed working (CAP_PROP_BUFFERSIZE = 1)
- **Main Agent**: All UI issues resolved - smooth video feed with stable controls

#### Streamlit API Updates (Round 5)
- **Main Agent**: Updated deprecated `use_container_width=True` to `width='stretch'` in all image displays
- **Main Agent**: Removed `use_container_width` from button components (not needed)
- **Main Agent**: Fixed 5 occurrences across webcam, video file, and image modes
- **Main Agent**: Code now compatible with Streamlit post-2025-12-31
- **Main Agent**: All code formatted and linted successfully

#### Button Spawning & Flickering Fix (Round 6)
- **Main Agent**: Fixed duplicate button spawning by separating button_container and video_container
- **Main Agent**: Buttons now render once at top, video content updates in separate container below
- **Main Agent**: Added unique button keys (start_webcam_btn, stop_webcam_btn) to prevent duplicates
- **Main Agent**: Fixed screen flickering caused by buttons moving around during st.rerun()
- **Main Agent**: Improved button click handling with start_clicked and stop_clicked variables
- **Main Agent**: Video feed now updates smoothly without affecting button positions
- **Main Agent**: Proper container separation eliminates layout shift issues
